Hello

This repository contains the course notes / programs / examples / for different
courses at Gamagora:

- Image synthesis (offline, theory about image, ray tracing)
- Real time image synthesis (gpu, rendering pipeline)
- Physics simulation.

In 2024, after years of creating different repositories each years for these
courses (since 2009), I decided to clean that mess and only have one repository
with all the content available. It means that final version of the source code
will be available in this repo for study, but please, try to not copy it
blindly.

Note also that because that's a "rebirth" of the repository, it 2024 it should
starts a bit empty, and will grow during the 2024 fall. Student: your are
highly encouraged to submit merge requests.
